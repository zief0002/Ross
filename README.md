ross: An R Package for Using Ross Ordering to Optimally Arrange Paired Comparisons
===

To control order effects in questionnaires containing paired comparisons, Ross (1934) described an optimal ordering of the 
pairings. The functions in this package construct the optimally spaced, balanced ordering of pairings. They can also create subsets of the pairs for either a matrix-sampling design or a fully incomplete design.
